WebAssembly can be leveraged to build applications for the cloud, taking advantage of its portability, security, and performance characteristics.

<p><b>Advantages:</b><p>

<b>Portability:</b> WebAssembly modules can run on various cloud platforms and environments, making it easier to deploy and scale applications across different cloud providers.
<b>Security:</b> WebAssembly's sandboxed execution model and memory isolation provide enhanced security compared to traditional native code, reducing the attack surface for cloud-based applications.
<b>Performance:</b> The near-native performance of WebAssembly makes it suitable for computationally intensive tasks often required in cloud environments, such as data processing, scientific computing, or machine learning.
<b>Modularity:</b> WebAssembly modules can be easily integrated into existing cloud-native architectures, allowing for a mix of technologies and programming languages within the same application.
